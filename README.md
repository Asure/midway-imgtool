# midway-imgtool
IMGTOOL for editing and creating IMG container files used by various Midway games.

# Dosbox users: 

You MUST use dosbox with ET4000 support, and the bios bin file.
Set the options in the conf file:

machine                                         = svga_et4000

Include the ET4000.BIN file in the dosbox installation.

# Setup

Copy IT.EXE and IT.HLP into C:\BIN. This is the default directory where IT checks for cfg and hlp files.

# useage

Press l to load a .img file. press h for help. I updated the hlp file quite a bit.
